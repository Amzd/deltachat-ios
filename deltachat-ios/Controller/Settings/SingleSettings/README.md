#  Single Settings

This folder is for settings that have their own dedicated View to change them.

## Naming

Class names should end with `SettingVC`, where `VC` is short for view controller, that way you can quickly see what it is in other places in the code

File names should be short and neither contain Settings nor controller, those words are redundant because the group/folder already tells what it is.
