#  Settings Pages

This group is for settings pages that combine multiple settings on one page.


## Naming

Class names should end with `SettingsPage` so they can be identified as what they are over the whole project.

File names should not contain `Settings`, `Controller`, nor `Page` because the group/folder already tells what it is.
