/**
 * This function takes a text and returns this text stripped by the first uuencoded part;
 * the uuencoded part itself is returned by three return parameters.
 *
 * If there are no uuencoded parts, the function terminates fast by returning NULL.
 *
 * @param text Null-terminated text to search uuencode parts in.
 *     The text is not modified, instead, the modified text is returned on success.
 * @param[out] ret_binary Points to a pointer that is set to the binary blob on
 *     success.
 *     The data is allocated with malloc() and must be free()'d by the caller.
 *     If no uuencoded part is found, this parameter is set to NULL and the function returns NULL.
 * @param[out] ret_binary_bytes Points to an integer that should be set to
 *     binary blob bytes on success.
 * @param[out] ret_filename Points to a pointer that should be set to the filename of the blob.
 *     The data is allocated with malloc() and must be free()'d by the caller.
 *     If no uuencoded part is found, this parameter is set to NULL and the function returns NULL.
 * @return If uuencoded parts are found in the given text, the function returns the
 *     given text stripped by the first uuencode block.
 *     The caller will call dc_uudecode_do() again with this remaining text then.
 *     This way, multiple uuencoded parts can be stripped from a text.
 *     If no uuencoded parts are found or on errors, NULL is returned.
